{"body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nThis Gospel Cantata is about John 9,1pp. What I like about the passage is how complicated the furor within the community plays out, and how almost callously Jesus treats the blind born person, pushing them first into the hub-hub, and then coming to pick them up to finish the conversion process.\r\n\r\nGreat stuff.\r\n\r\n# Texts\r\n\r\nThe summary can be found here.\r\n\r\nThe research notes can be found here.","name":"John-nine","tagline":"A Gospel Cantata inspired by John 9,1pp","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
