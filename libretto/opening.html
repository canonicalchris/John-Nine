<!--
Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as HaShem your G-d has commanded you. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to HaShem your G-d.  On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor the alien within your gates, so that your manservant and maidservant may rest, as you do. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that HaShem your G-d brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore HaShem your G-d has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.
