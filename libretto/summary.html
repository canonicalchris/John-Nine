  <h1>Summary of John 9,1pp -- A Gospel Cantata</h1>

  <p>
   As the sun rises on the day of the Sabbath, the people rejoice
   in the way that the Justice of the Lord presents itself with
   the sunrise, as the sun reveals all iniquities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, Jesus and his disciples encounter a beggar woman at one
   of the city gates of Jerusalem who was born blind. The disciples
   wish to know how the Justice of the Lord reveals herself in the
   blind-born woman: is it her own sin, or her parents, that made her
   thus? 
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus denies both interpretations. This woman is a sign for the world
   of the coming light.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus speaks to the woman. She tells him that she was born blind
   and that she desired two things most in the world -- to see her
   husband's eyes and her children's smiles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus sends her to the Shiloh pond, telling her that it will heal
   her; she refuses to go, because she does not believe anything will
   happen. Jesus then puts mud on her eyes and asks her to go wash it
   off; this time she has little choice and oblieges him.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the pond, her family sees her wash off the mud and
   watches in amazement as she can finally see: her parents, her
   husband's eyes, her children smiling. They praise God together.
   The parents are relieved that it was not their sin that caused 
   the blindness.
