<h2>Aria: Anger and Healing</h2>

<p>
Who gives you the right // to spatter me with dreck? <br>
Are you not a teacher // is your mind a speck? <br>
I was born blind, I will never see.
</p>
<p>
Has all your preaching and fasting // made you so sour <br>
that you have to walk in here // to show off your power <br>
by trying your folk magic on me?
</p>
<p>
While I walk to Shiloh Pond // my gate-side spot is gone <br>
which means I have to beg // in the scorching sun <br>
rabbi, all that, thanks to thee!
</p>
<!-- verse about the pun of Shiloh and "sending"
<!-- verse about giving Jesus an earful when he and the
     disciples should return -->
<!-- And now she can see-->
<!-- and we revert to the end of :Sunrise in Jerusalem: -->
<p>
And as this unexpected light<br>
floods my vision and my fear<br>
I behold the things I longed so long to see<br>
My children's smiles,<br>
my husband's eyes<br>
and the Temple of my God, Lord Zebaoth.
</p>
