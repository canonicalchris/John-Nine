<h2>Aria: Anger and Healing</h2>

<p>
Who gives you the right // to spatter me with dreck? <br>
Are you not a teacher // is your mind a speck? <br>
I was born blind, I will never see.
</p>
<p>
Has all your fasting // made you so sour <br>
that you walk in here // and show off your power <br>
by trying your folk magic on me?
</p>
