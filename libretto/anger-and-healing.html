    <h1>Aria: Anger and Healing</h1>

    <p>
      Who gives you the right // to spatter me with dreck? <br>
      Are you not a teacher // is your mind a speck? <br>
      I was born blind, I will never see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Has all your preaching and fasting // made you so sour <br>
      that you have to walk in here // to show off your power <br>
      by trying your folk magic on me?
    </p>
    <p>
      While I walk to Shiloh Pond // my gate-side spot is gone <br>
      which means I have to beg // in the scorching sun <br>
      rabbi, all that, thanks to thee!
    </p>
    <!-- verse about the pun of Shiloh and "sending" -->
    <!-- verse about giving Jesus an earful when he and the
	 disciples should return -->
    <!-- And now she can see-->
    <!-- and we revert to the end of :Sunrise in Jerusalem: -->
    <p>
      And as this unexpected light<br>
      floods my vision and my fear<br>
      I behold the things I longed so long to see<br>
      My children's smiles,<br>
      my husband's eyes<br>
      and the Temple of my God, Lord Zebaoth.
